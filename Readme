Program 'rasniffer'

# rasniffer -i <interface> [-r] [-s]

The program waits on an interface <interface> for ICMPv6 packets.
It uses the NIC in promiscuous mode.
After receiving an ICMPv6 packet it filters out the Router Advertisement
packets.

Information about the ICMP packet as well as RA information is then
printed to the standard output.

(source, destination IPv6 address, router lifetime, prefix, MTU,
source / target link layer address, ...)

With the -r option the sniffer sets the priority of a RA packet
to low and sends it to the network.

The -s option causes the program to send an Router Solicitation
packet with source-link address set to the MAC address of the interface <interface>.
